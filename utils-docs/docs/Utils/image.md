        -- **quality [default: 0.9]** - The image quality (0 to 1) for compression.

### convertToBase64

It returns a Promise that resolves with an object containing the Base64 image data and the filename. `Promise<{filename: string; src: string}>`

#### Options

-   `file[required]: File` - The File object to convert to Base64.

### isSupportedImageFormat

### numToUint8Array

Get Uint8Array from number.

It returns `Uint8Array`.

#### Options

-   `num[required]: number` - The number to convert to Uint8Array.
-   `arraySize[optional]: number` - default 4.

### generateChunks

Turn binary into array of chunks.

It returns an array of Uint8Array chunks. `Uint8Array[]`

#### Options

-   `binary[required]: Uint8Array` - Uint8Array to be chunked.

### readFile
